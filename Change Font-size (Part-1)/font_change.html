         <h2>Defination Of LOVE</h2>
         <p>
            Love encompasses a range of strong and positive emotional and mental
            states, from the most sublime virtue or good habit, the deepest
            interpersonal affection, to the simplest pleasure.[1][2] An example of
            this range of meanings is that the love of a mother differs from the
            love of a spouse, which differs from the love of food. Most commonly,
            love refers to a feeling of strong attraction and emotional
            attachment.[3] Love is considered to be both positive and negative,
            with its virtue representing human kindness, compassion, and
            affection, as "the unselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good
            of another" and its vice representing human moral flaw, akin to
            vanity, selfishness, amour-propre, and egotism, as potentially leading
            people into a type of mania, obsessiveness or codependency.[4][5] It
            may also describe compassionate and affectionate actions towards other
            humans, one's self or animals.[6] In its various forms, love acts as a
            major facilitator of interpersonal relationships and, owing to its
            central psychological importance, is one of the most common themes in
            the creative arts.[7] Love has been postulated to be a function that
            keeps human beings together against menaces and to facilitate the
            continuation of the species.[8] Ancient Greek philosophers identified
            six forms of love: essentially, familial love (in Greek, Storge),
            friendly love or platonic love (Philia), romantic love (Eros),
            self-love (Philautia) , guest love (Xenia) and divine love (Agape).
            Modern authors have distinguished further varieties of love:
            unrequited love, empty love, companionate love, consummate love,
            infatuated love, self-love, and courtly love. Numerous cultures have
            also distinguished Ren, Yuanfen, Mamihlapinatapai, Cafuné, Kama,
            Bhakti, Mettā, Ishq, Chesed, Amore, Charity, Saudade (and other
            variants or symbioses of these states), as culturally unique words,
            definitions, or expressions of love in regards to a specified
            "moments" currently lacking in the English language.[9][10][11]
            Scientific research on emotion has increased significantly over the
            past two decades. The color wheel theory of love defines three
            primary, three secondary and nine tertiary love styles, describing
            them in terms of the traditional color wheel. The triangular theory of
            love suggests "intimacy, passion and commitment" are core components
            of love. Love has additional religious or spiritual meaning. This
            diversity of uses and meanings combined with the complexity of the
            feelings involved makes love unusually difficult to consistently
            define, compared to other emotional states.
