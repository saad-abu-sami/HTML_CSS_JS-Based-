            <h3>Web & Mobile Development</h3>
            <p>
               With the global mobile app market booming and expected to be worth $139 billion by 2021, it is no surprise
               that it is common for established organisations to have a web presence which includes complex interacting
               systems.
               Web and mobile development are critical application areas for computer science. Many of the largest
               technology companies maintain large scale web applications, providing services such as social media, search,
               advertising and video and audio streaming. Mobile application development has become a major part of the
               software industry over the last decade, with established as well as new companies developing thousands of
               mobile games and utilities.

            <h3>Customer Support</h3>
            <p>
               Customer support automation involves the building of a knowledge base of known issues and their resolution
               to support incidents with delivery mechanisms, often by expert systems. A service automation platform
               includes a suite of support solutions including proactive support, assisted support and self-support.
               With automated support, service organizations can make their services available to their customers 24 hours
               a day and 7 days a week, by monitoring alarms, identifying problems at an early stage and resolving issues
               before they become problems. Automated assisted support enables remote access to sites that need instant
               problem solving. By automating the collection of information of devices and applications coexisting with the
               supported application, problems can be quickly fixed.

            <h3>Marketing & Communication </h3>
            <p>
               Marketing communication (MarCom) is a fundamental and complex part of a company’s marketing efforts. Loosely
               defined, MarCom can be described as all the messages and media you deploy to communicate with the market.
               Marketing communication includes advertising, direct marketing, branding, packaging, your online presence,
               printed materials, PR activities, sales presentations, sponsorships, trade show appearances and more.
               The complexity of the MarCom topic makes it too broad to cover in one article. This article is one in a
               series of six that covers the field of marketing communication. The full list of the titles in this series.
